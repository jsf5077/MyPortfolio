              Hello, I am a Full-Stack Web Developer leveraging 5+ years of
              experience in graphic design to build a unique user experience
              on web applications. Recently, I earned a certificate in
              Full-Stack Web Development from the University of Pennsylvania.
              I am passionate about newly my developed skills in Javascript,
              CSS, Bootstrap, React.js, MySQL, MongoDB, and responsive web
              design. Throughout my career, I have been a versatile problem
              solver with strong organizational skills, whose determination
              and patience has led to impactful results. I enjoy creating
              applications within a team setting that have strong UIâ€™s that
              are easy-to-use and intuitive. I am looking forward to joining a
              team where I will contribute strengths in creativity, branding,
              and communication from my graphic design experience.
